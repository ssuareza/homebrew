## Usage

First of all, [install Homebrew itself.](http://brew.sh/)

Now you can add the tap (this repository) to your system:

```bash
brew tap ssuareza/brew git@github.com:ssuareza/homebrew
```

And then you can install the tools provided by the tap. For example, install the current version of `gssh`:

```bash
brew install ssuareza/brew/gssh
```
